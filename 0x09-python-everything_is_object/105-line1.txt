At that point in the code, three integer objects have been created and are still in memory. This is because Python pre-creates a pool of small integer objects at startup, ranging from -5 to 256, and these objects are reused whenever the same value is needed again. This optimization helps to reduce memory usage and improve performance by avoiding unnecessary object creation for commonly used integers within that range. Therefore, when the code executes the print("Love") statement, the integer objects for 0, 1, and 2 have already been created and are still in memory due to this optimization.
